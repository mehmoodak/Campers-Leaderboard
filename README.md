# Campers Leaderboard

This project is made to complete a challange on FreeCodeCamp as a part of getting React Certification. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

In this project I made a campers leaderboard which shows campers of FreeCodeCamp in acsending order and descending order based on their points of lifetime or in month which depends on the selection user made .
